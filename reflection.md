- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

i made a class that represents your charracter in stardew valley. StardewCharacter is the class that implements the Contract interface, which hasÂ a variety of methods for working with objects and carrying out activities. In addition to an energy bar that controls their capacity to carry out tasks, the character has an inventory to hold items.There are certain actions that the character can carry out in the game that each method in the class relates to. for example, picking up an object and putting it in their inventory is done by the grab(String item) command.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
There are other methods in the StardewCharacter class for handling the character's energy in addition to the ones listed in the Contract interface. one of these is a constructor (StardewCharacter()) that, when creating your character, makes the character's energy and inventory. In addition, there are functions for manipulating energy: shrink() reduces the character's energy by 10 units, while expand() raises it by 20 units. The character's energy is replenished to a maximum of 100 units via the rest() function. These methods are needed for controlling the character's energy, which affects their capacity to carry out different activities like mining and farming in Stardew Valley. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think allowing the freedom with this assignment helped alot. I really enjoy stardew valley so adding some things from the game was really cool.
